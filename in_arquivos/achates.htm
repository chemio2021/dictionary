After Achates, the faithful companion and friend of Aeneas, in the epic poem 
Aeneid by the Roman poet Vergil (70-19 BCE). In the story, Achates is called 
fidus Achates (faithful Achates) and he accompanies Aeneas everywhere in his 
adventures. <br>

trusty Achates.&quot;<br>

	A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
A few minutes ago every tree was excited, bowing to the roaring storm, waving, 
swirling, tossing their branches in glorious enthusiasm like worship. But though 
to the outer ear these trees are now silent, their songs never cease. Every 
hidden cell is throbbing with music and life, every fiber thrilling like harp 
strings, while incense is ever flowing from the balsam bells and leaves. No 
wonder the hills and groves were God's first temples, and the more they are cut 
down and hewn into cathedrals and churches, the farther off and dimmer seems the 
Lord himself. -John Muir, naturalist, explorer, and writer (1838-1914) <br>
