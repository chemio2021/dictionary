<br>
Anachronism can be of two kinds: parachronism, when the assigned date is<br>
too late, and prochronism, when the date is too early. Even language can<br>
be fraught with anachronism. Imagine a science fiction story where the<br>
protagonist rides a time machine to go back some 500 years. While there,<br>
he comments how &quot;nice&quot; someone's dress is. Well, at that time the word<br>
nice would have meant &quot;stupid&quot;. Sometimes anachronism can be unintentional,<br>
a story written in 1970 and set in 2000 that features the USSR, for example.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; halfway through the show.&quot;<br>
