<p><b>Areology</b> (ar-ee-OL-uh-jee) noun<br>
<br>
&nbsp; The study of the planet Mars.<br>
<br>
[From areo- (Mars), from Greek Areaos, from Ares (The Greek equivalent<br>
of Mars in classical mythology) + logy (study).]<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &quot;There is also (to my tastes) far too much technical discussion of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; terraforming and areology, particularly in the first half of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; book.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn C. Leeper; Book Review (Green Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyberspace Vanguard; Mar 31, 1994.<br>
<br>
Did you get to say hello while our planetary neighbor Mars stopped by for<br>
a little t&#44325;-&#2932;&#44325; with the earth recently? We enjoyed the closer view<br>
of the red planet from our backyard and afterward had a minor earthly<br>
adventure. We had locked ourselves out. After some brainstorming, we<br>
formed a human totem pole so that our six-year-old daughter at the top<br>
could scramble through an open second-story window and unlock the front<br>
door for her parents.<br>
<br>
When you view life on a cosmic scale, all the fights about a few feet of<br>
earth or a few pieces of printed paper begin to look ridiculous. Imagine<br>
a world where all of us can look through a telescope instead of looking<br>
at a TV! I can't think of a better reality show to gaze at.<br>
