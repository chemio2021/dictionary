&quot;When settlers first came to Pullman, they found artesian water bubbling<br>
out of the ground. A hundred years later, those springs are gone, and<br>
the source of this hydrological abundance continues to drop 1.5 feet<br>
per year. Water mining is just that -- and sooner or later, someone's<br>
going to have to pay the piper.&quot;<br>
