<p><b>Beestings</b> (BEE-stingz) noun, also beastings, biestings<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; First milk produced by a mammal, especially a cow, after giving 
birth. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Also known as colostrum or foremilk.<br>
<br>
[From Middle English bestynge, from Old English bysting.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &quot;Two thriving calves she suckles twice a day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And twice besides her beestings never fail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To store the dairy with a brimming pail.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Publius Vergilius Maro (translated by John Dryden); The Works of 
Virgil.<br>
<br>
Recently my daughter turned six and received a magic kit as a birthday<br>
present. She was visibly excited, &quot;Now I can be like Harry Potter!&quot; She<br>
opened the cardboard box and a bunch of strings, ribbons, playing cards,<br>
and a few other earthly objects came tumbling down. She asked me to read<br>
the accompanying instructions. I explained, &quot;You tie one end of the ribbon<br>
to the black string and hide it behind your shirt collar. Then you pull<br>
the string with one hand and the ribbon magically appears!&quot; She looked at me<br>
incredulously, &quot;That's not magic! You have to hide the ribbon first.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, it took some explaining that that's how the magic worked. The<br>
disappointment was palpable. The Easter Bunny is already dead. Eventually, the<br>
Tooth Fairy and Santa will also give way. She's growing up and growing<br>
wiser. That's the price we pay to grow up.<br>
<br>
One day, she'll be old enough to weave her own magic. The Tooth Fairy and<br>
friends will come alive for her again as they did for us when she was born.<br>
And the cycle will continue. Meanwhile, we're in no hurry.<br>
<br>
This week's words are somewhat like that magic. These unusual,<br>
out-of-this-world words aren't what they appear to be. They play a trick on<br>
us but a closer look reveals the secret. There are neither bees nor stings in<br>
beestings. Look for more words like that this week.<br>
