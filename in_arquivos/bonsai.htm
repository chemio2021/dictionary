  A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
<p>Religions are not revealed: they are evolved. If a religion were revealed by 
God, that religion would be perfect in whole and in part, and would be as 
perfect at the first moment of its revelation as after ten thousand years of 
practice. There has never been a religion that which fulfills those conditions. 
-Robert Blatchford, author (1851-1943)</p>
