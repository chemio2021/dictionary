<p><b>Buckley's chance</b> (BUK-leez chans) noun<br>
&nbsp;<br>
No chance at all (or only a very slim chance).<br>
Also called &quot;Buckley's and none&quot; or &quot;Buckley's hope&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
[The origin of the term isn't certain but the most popular story pins it<br>
to William Buckley (1780-1856), a British convict transported to Australia.<br>
There, he escaped and found refuge among the Aborigines for more than three<br>
decades. When he was rediscovered he had forgotten how to speak English.<br>
Since survival in the outback was difficult it was said that anyone lost<br>
there had Buckley's chance of making it.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Another possibility is a pun on the Melbourne department store Buckley<br>
and Nunn, i.e. one has two chances: Buckley's or none.]<br>

&quot;First of all, understand that Kookaburra III has Buckley's chance of<br>
beating Stars &amp; Stripes.&quot;<br>
