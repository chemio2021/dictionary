&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purging, by means of self-induced vomiting, laxatives, etc.<br>

Literally speaking, bulimia is ox hunger. It's not clear whether it<br>
means one could eat like a bull, or eat a whole bull. It's also known<br>
as boulimia, bulimia nervosa, bulimarexia, binge-purge syndrome.<br>
<br>
It's a strange world where some eat and then throw it up lest they<br>
become fat, while there are millions who go to bed hungry, even in a<br>
rich nation like the USA.<br>

&nbsp; &quot;Eating disorders are also a daily subject for viewers of the prime-time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; soap opera 'The Pages of Our Lives,' in which a 15-year-old ballet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; dancer suffers from bulimia, secretly making herself vomit after eating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to keep her weight down.&quot;<br>
