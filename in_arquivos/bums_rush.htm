								<font size="2">USAGE:</font></div>
							&quot;Anyone who has dealt with [Don] Givens will attest 
							to his courtesy once he is treated courteously 
							himself. But when given the <u>bum's rush</u> by 
							swaggering footballers or asked legitimate questions, 
							the courtesy turns to prickliness and his own ego 
							becomes evident.&quot;<br>
