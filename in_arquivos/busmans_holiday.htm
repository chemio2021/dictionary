<p><b>Busman's holiday </b>(BUS-manz HOL-i-day) noun<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A holiday spent doing things as at work.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
[Imagine a bus driver having a day off, 'enjoying' a bus ride and you'll<br>
have a pretty good idea of this term. Going on a long drive might be<br>
a great vacation for many of us, but not for a bus driver. Of course,<br>
when the phrase came up some 200 years ago, bus drivers had charge of<br>
horse-drawn buses. The term is sometimes seen as 'businessman's holiday'.]<br>

&quot;Boundless energy and vaulting ambition carried Nicolas Sarkozy to the<br>
presidency of France. Now that he has had just over 100 days in office<br>
(including a hyperactive busman's holiday in New Hampshire), it is a<br>
good time to take stock of where all this energy may be leading.&quot;<br>
