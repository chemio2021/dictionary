<p><b>Tartuffe</b> (tahr-TOOF) noun<br>

A hypocrite who feigns virtue, especially in religious matters.<br>

[After the main character in Tartuffe, a play by Moli&#3656;re, pen name of<br>

&quot;Tony Blair is like Harold Wilson, an empty vessel whose strength<br>
derives from his emptiness. (Religion is so often a substitute<br>
for depth.) Because he is a Tartuffe who does not really believe<br>
in anything, he is brilliant at seizing advantage; when he can't<br>
manipulate events, he surfs over them.&quot;<br>
