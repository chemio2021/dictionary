  USAGE:</div>
<p>&quot;Without formal training -- just passion, energy, and discards from the local 
nursery -- Pearl Fryar began sculpting his acreage into a dazzling array of 
abstract topiary art, earning this sharecropper's son the local 'Yard of the 
Month' award. Nowadays, Pearl's hugely expanded, wildly impressive topiary 
garden has become a major tourist attraction. Inspired yet? Wait till you see 
the winning documentary &quot;A Man Named Pearl&quot;, which not only makes you want to 
get out there and play Edward Scissorhands but can, at least for its 78 jazz-and-gospel 
infused minutes, help replenish one's faith in humanity.&quot;<br>

&quot;But Warriors players won't say why they've made a mutual pact to let their 
facial topiary run wild.&quot;<br>

  A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
<p>Some people with great virtues are disagreeable, while others with great 
vices are delightful. -Francois, duc de La Rochefoucauld, moralist (1613-1680)</p>
