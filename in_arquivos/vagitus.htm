<p><b>Vagitus</b> (vuh-JI-tuhs) noun<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cry of a newborn.<br>
<br>
[From Latin vagire (to wail).]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A newborn child's cry is called vagitus. Babies' cries have been 
heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; even before their births. It's rare but vagitus uterinus has been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; observed on occasions when the membranes rupture, allowing air to 
enter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the uterine cavity.<br>
<br>
-Anu Garg (garg AT wordsmith.org)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &quot;[Pnin] unfolded, for he actually seemed to forehear the babe's vagitus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and its first word in the near future.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vladimir Nabokov; Pnin; 1957.<br>
