&nbsp; &quot;This wight ventripotent was dining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once at the Grocers' Hall, and lining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With calipee and calipash<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That tomb omnivorous -- his paunch.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Horace Smith; The Astronomical Alderman; 19th century.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Calipee and calipash are parts of a turtle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneath the lower and upper shields, 
respectively)<br>

&nbsp; &quot;The actor must, at all costs, inflict upon you the well-oiled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; machinery of ventripotence, whereas, to the reader, it is his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; mind which drips fatness.&quot;<br>
