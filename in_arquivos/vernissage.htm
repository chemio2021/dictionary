<p><b>Vernissage</b> (ver-nuh-SAZH) noun<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A private showing or preview of an art exhibition before the public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; opening; also the reception celebrating the opening of an art 
exhibition.<br>
<br>
[From French vernissage (varnishing), from vernis (varnish), ultimately<br>
from Berenik, the name of an ancient city in Cyrenaica in northern Africa<br>
where natural resins were first used as varnish.]<br>
<br>
Traditionally, the day before the official opening of an art exhibition<br>
was reserved for the artist to varnish or put finishing touches to their<br>
paintings.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &quot;On the night of the Vernissage, which must surely provide perfect<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; art-buying conditions - lashings of bubbles and money in the same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; rooms - the red stickers are going up.&quot;<br>
