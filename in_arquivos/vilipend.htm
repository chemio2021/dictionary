<p><b>Vilipend</b> (VIL-uh-pend) verb tr.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
1. To treat someone with contempt.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
2. To disparage.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
[From Old French vilipender, from Latin vilipendere, from vilis<br>
(cheap, worthless) + pendere (to consider). The words vilify,<br>
vile, revile, and venal are all cousins of this word.]<br>

&quot;Every month those of us who teach at Columbia (the University) are<br>
supposed to be paid, and every month last fall I wasn't. This seems not<br>
to have been a value judgment. They say the computer can't find me; I am<br>
so random I am inaccessible. Still, if I were a tenant in one of the many<br>
hovels owned by the University, and failed for months to pay my rent, you<br>
can bet Columbia (the Landlord) would have flopped my disk soon enough.<br>
Most of us are tenants in this society, which is why it is necessary to<br>
anathematize and vilipend the landlords, our owners.&quot;<br>
