<br>
The vitreous humor, or vitreous, is the glassy clear sticky material within<br>
the eye. Its actual function is still unknown. When the vitreous gel<br>
separates from the retina, one can get &quot;floaters and flashes&quot;. During some<br>
types of retinal surgery, the vitreous is removed (a vitrectomy) and<br>
replaced with saline solution, with seemingly no ill effect in most cases.<br>
&quot;Vitreous&quot; also means &quot;glassy&quot; in a non-medical sense, from which we get<br>
vitrine, vitriol, vitriolic, and vitrescent.<br>

&nbsp; &quot;I stuck my fist in the air and screamed as my eyes exploded and vitreous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; humour ran down my cheeks and my face melted from their sheer onslaught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of power Witch was broadcasting. It was awesome.&quot;<br>
