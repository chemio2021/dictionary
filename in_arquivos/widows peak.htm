<p><b>Widow's peak</b> (WID-oz peek) noun<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A V-shaped hairline at the center top of the forehead.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
[From the former belief that this feature in a woman was an omen that she'd<br>
outlive her husband, as in those days a widow wore a mourning hood with a<br>
pointed crest.]<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Earlier, this feature in a man was known as a widower's peak, though today<br>
widow's peak is a unisex term. It's not known what the superstition said<br>
when two people with widow's peak married each other. Examples of people<br>
with widow's peaks: John Travolta, Count Dracula.<br>
