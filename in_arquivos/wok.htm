Every time you put a dollop of &quot;ketchup&quot; on your fries, you may be referring<br>
to Cantonese, the possible source of the word. Although traditionally<br>
regarded as a dialect of the Chinese language, Cantonese is different<br>
enough to be considered a separate language. They are about as common as,<br>
say, French and Italian.<br>
<br>
The word Cantonese derives from the name of Guangdong Province in South China.<br>
The Cantonese language is spoken in many parts of the world, including<br>
Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in southern China, Hong Kong and Macao, many<br>
countries in Southeast Asia and in Chinatowns of major cities in countries<br>
such as US, Canada, and Australia. As I'll be visiting Hong Kong later this<br>
week, where it is an official language (along with English), I've collected<br>
Cantonese words that are now part of the English language. Look for five<br>
such words this week.<br>
