[From Old English wefan (to weave).]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It had the features of a righteous man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; benevolent in countenance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; but all the rest of it was serpent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It had forepaws, hairy to the armpits,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and back and chest and both its flanks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; were painted and inscribed with rings and curlicues.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; So many vivid colors Turk or Tartar never wove<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Inferno XVII.10-18.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Dante's description of Geryon, the monster representing Fraud. The 
passage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is often admired for its poetic exuberance. The traveler's trip 
down into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the depths of hell on Geryon's back is one of the most 
extraordinary <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; descriptions in the entire poem, rendering the height of fantasy as 
though<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; it had actually occurred.&quot;<br>
