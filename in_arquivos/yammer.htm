&quot;Every year, hundreds of those metallic helium balloons that some little<br>
kid lets go of by accident, or some misguided romantic releases into the<br>
sky like a shiny-bright dove, float up into electric lines and knock out<br>
the power hundreds of times over. ... The Balloon Council, evidently full<br>
of its own product, is yammering about how [the proposal to ban them]<br>
criminalizes a toy.&quot;<br>
