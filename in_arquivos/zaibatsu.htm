<p><b>Zaibatsu</b> (ZAI-ba-tsoo) noun, plural zaibatsu<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A large family-owned Japanese commercial combine that holds 
controlling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; interests in a variety of areas. After WWII, zaibatsu dissolved 
into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; keiretsu, a loose coalition of business groups that own stakes in 
one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; another. For example, Mitsubishi, which supplies automobiles, 
electricity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; glass, ships, aircraft, satellites, oil products, beer, etc.<br>
<br>
[From Japanese, zai wealth + batsu clique].<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mandai, our chairman, was one of Japan's great bankers. He had 
been the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; head of Mitsui Bank before the war and was still regarded almost as 
a deity <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; by the staff. Like many others connected with the old giant 
financial <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; combines, the zaibatsu, he had been purged by the Occupation 
authorities.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The challenge is great; success depends only on the strength of our will,&quot;<br>
is how Akio Morita, co-founder of Sony Corporation, concludes his<br>
biographical book, &quot;Made in Japan: Akio Morita and Sony.&quot; Sony truly is a<br>
translation of Akio Morita's willpower and vision. Born on Jan 26, 1921 in<br>
Nagoya, Japan, in a family of sake brewers, Morita was more interested in<br>
brewing of technology. In 1946, he co-founded a radio repair business in a<br>
bombed-out department store that was eventually to become Sony, a name<br>
synonymous with innovation and quality. He came up with the name Sony after<br>
consulting several dictionaries and creating a derivative from sonus, Latin<br>
for sound. He first considered the name Sonny but dropped it when he realized<br>
that in Japan, &quot;the word `sonny' would be pronounced as `sohn-nee' which<br>
means to lose money.&quot; This week we remember him by picking words from his<br>
aforesaid book.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
